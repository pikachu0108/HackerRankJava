/*You are developing a smartphone app. You have a list of potential customers for your app. Each customer has a budget and will buy the app at your declared price if and only if the price is less than or equal to the customer's budget.
You want to fix a price so that the revenue you earn from the app is maximized. Find this maximum possible revenue.
For instance, suppose you have 4 potential customers and their budgets are 30, 20, 53 and 14. In this case, the maximum revenue you can get is 60 .

Input Format
Line 1 : N, the total number of potential customers.
Lines 2 to N+1: Each line has the budget of a potential customer.
Constraints
